The idea behind this project is to take text from a webpage, run it through an OCR engine, and then Google the text. This application would be great at answering Jeopardy questions (if we could just get it to work with the online tests).

Instructions:

1) Open .sln file in Visual Studio.
2) Build and Run Project.
3) Make Full Screen.
4) On the pink side, enter a web address (NOTE it must be http:// or program will break). For example http://google.com
5) Click Arrow next to URL box to go to address. Sorry Enter does not work.
6) Click DoOCR in the bottom left-hand corner.
7) The Blue side will google search the OCR-read text on the blue side. For example: Business CLE I'm Feeling Lucky coo Google Search Watch how today's doodle was made About


What We Want to Do:

1) On the Blue side go to https://www.jeopardy.com/be-a-contestant/ 
2) Scroll Down and Click: Take the Practice Test.
3) Scroll Down to Adult and click Take The Practice Test.
4) The Pink Side will Open the Practice Test, But the Timer Does not Start!

Whoever can figure out how to get the test to work is a boss.
